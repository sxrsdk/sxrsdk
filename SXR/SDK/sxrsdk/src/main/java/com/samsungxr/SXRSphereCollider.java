/**
 * A sphere collider allows a scene object to be picked
 * when a ray penetrates its bounding sphere.
 * 
 * This is the fastest but least accurate method of picking.
 * It performs a ray-sphere intersection and works best
 * on scene objects which do not vary a lot in their
 * X, Y and Z dimensions.
 * 
 * The center of the collision sphere is the center of
 * the scene object it is attached to. If no radius is
 * provided, the radius is obtained from the bounding
 * volume of the scene object.
 *
 * You can use a sphere collider on a scene object without
 * a mesh if you specify the radius by calling setRadius.
 * This radius is transformed by the world matrix on the scene object
 * so it will scale as the scene object does.
