/**
 * Finds the scene objects in a scene which collide with the bounding volumes
 * of a set of specific objects (called collidables).
 * <p>
 * This picker provides a simple form of bounds-based collision detection
 * for a small set of objects. If you have a large number of objects or
 * complex collision shapes, the physics extension would be a better choice.
 * The bounds picker can be useful for designating trigger areas in your scene
 * that generate events when other objects penetrate. Internally GearVRF
 * uses this picker for object cursor hit testing.
 * <p/>
 * For a {@linkplain SXRNode scene object} to be pickable, it must have a
 * {@link SXRCollider} component attached to it that is enabled.
 * The picker compares the bounds for set of scene objects against all these
 * colliders and returns an array with the collisions as instances of SXRPickedObject.
 * The picked object contains the collider instance hit, the distance from the
 * center of the object it collided with and the hit position.
 * <p/>
 * The picker maintains the list of current collisions
 * (which can be obtained with getPicked()) and continually updates it each frame.
 * The picker also generates one or more pick / touch events which are
 * sent to the event receiver of the scene and the picker. These events can be
 * observed by listeners.
 * <ul>
 * <li>onEnter          called when a collidable scene object penetrates a collider.</li>
 * <li>onExit           called when a collidable scene object leaves a collider.</li>
 * <li>onInside         called when a collidable scene object is inside a collider.</li>
 * <li>onTouchStart     called when the action button is pressed during a collision.</li>
 * <li>onTouchEnd       called when the action button is released during a collision.</li>
 * <li>onPick           called every frame if a collision occured.</li>
 * <li>onNoPick         called every frame if no collisions occurred.</li>
