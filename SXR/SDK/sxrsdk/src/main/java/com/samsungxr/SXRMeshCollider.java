/**
 * Represents collision geometry that is a mesh.

 * A {@link SXRCollider} is something that is being pointed at by a picking
 * ray. {@linkplain SXRCollider Colliders} are attached to
 * {@link SXRNode scene objects.} The {@link SXRPicker} will return an
 * array of SXRColliders: you use {@link SXRCollider#getOwnerObject()} to retrieve the scene object.
 *
 * <p>
 * A MeshCollider holds the {@link SXRMesh} that the picking ray will be
 * tested against. If no mesh is specified, it will use the mesh
 * attached to the SXRNode that owns it.
 *
 * You do not need to wait for the mesh to load before attaching the collider.
 * If the scene object that owns the mesh collider does not have a mesh and
 * the mesh collider doesn't have one, the scene object will not be pickable.
