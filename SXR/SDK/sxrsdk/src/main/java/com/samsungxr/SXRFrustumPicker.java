/**
 * Finds the scene objects that are within a view frustum.
 *
 * The picker can function in two modes. One way is to simply call its
 * static functions to make a single scan through the scene to determine
 * what is within the view frustum.
 *
 * The other way is to add the picker as a component to a scene object
 * and specify the view frustum dimensions. The viewpoint of the frustum
 * is the center of the scene object. The view direction is the forward
 * direction of the scene object. The frustum will pick what a camera
 * attached to the scene object with that view frustum would see.
 *
 * For a {@linkplain SXRNode scene object} to be pickable, it must have a
 * {@link SXRCollider} component attached to it that is enabled.
 * The picker returns an array containing all the collisions as instances of SXRPickedObject.
 * The picked object contains the collider instance, the distance from the
 * origin of the view frustum and the center of the object.
 *
 * The picker maintains the list of currently
 * picked objects which can be obtained with getPicked() and continually
 * updates it each frame. When a pickable object is inside the view frustum,
 * the picker generates one or more pick events (IPickEvents interface)
 * which are sent the event receiver of the scene. These events can be
 * observed by listeners.
 *  - onEnter(SXRNode)  called when the scene object enters the frustum.
 *  - onExit(SXRNode)   called when the scene object exits the frustum.
 *  - onInside(SXRNode) called while the scene object is inside the frustum.
 *  - onPick(SXRPicker)        called when the set of picked objects changes.
 *  - onNoPick(SXRPicker)      called once when nothing is picked.
